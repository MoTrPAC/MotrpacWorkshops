# MoTrPAC Workshops

### MoTrPAC R Packages Workshop Overview

Welcome to the MoTrPAC Endurance Exercise Training Workshop! This workshop will guide participants through the use of essential R packages developed as part of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC). We will explore how to efficiently access, analyze, and visualize data from the first comprehensive multi-omic study of endurance exercise effects in rats. The workshop is designed to provide both an overview of the available datasets and hands-on experience with the analysis workflows.

Participants will learn how to utilize R to interact with multi-tissue, multi-omic data, understand key study variables, and generate informative visualizations, such as volcano plots and principal component analyses. This workshop is suitable for those with basic R knowledge who are interested in learning about bioinformatics tools and approaches for exercise physiology research. 
