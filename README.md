# MoTrPAC Workshops

This repo compiles R notebooks to guide participants through the use of 
essential R packages developed as part of the Molecular Transducers of 
Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC). 
The code is designed to provide both an overview of the available datasets 
and hands-on experience with the analysis workflows.

### Workshop: MoTrPAC R Packages from the Endurance Training in Young Rats Study

The notebook `rat-endurance-6m.Rmd` available in vignettes 
(check the 
[html version here](https://motrpac.github.io/MotrpacWorkshops/docs/articles/rat-endurance-6m.html)) 
focuses on the analysis of endurance exercise training data from the MoTrPAC study, 
specifically using the 
`MotrpacRatTraining6moData` and 
`MotrpacRatTraining6moAnalysis` 
R packages (and some functions around them). 
Participants will learn how to install and utilize these packages to analyze 
multi-omic data from a cohort of young rats subjected to endurance training 
over a 6-month period.
